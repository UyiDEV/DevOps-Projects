# Day 1: Introduction to Linux

## Objectives
- Understand what Linux is and its history.
- Learn about different Linux distributions.
- Install a Linux distribution on your computer or set up a virtual machine.

## What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system based on Unix. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Unlike proprietary operating systems, Linux is free to use, modify, and distribute. It has become the backbone of many systems, from personal computers to servers and mobile devices.

### Key Features of Linux
- **Open Source**: The source code is available for anyone to view, modify, and enhance.
- **Multiuser**: Multiple users can access system resources simultaneously without interfering with each other.
- **Multitasking**: Capable of running multiple processes at the same time.
- **Portability**: Can run on various hardware platforms.
- **Security**: Known for its robust security features.

## History of Linux
Linux was inspired by the Unix operating system, which was developed in the 1970s. Linus Torvalds began developing Linux as a personal project while he was a student at the University of Helsinki. Over time, it gained contributions from developers worldwide and evolved into a powerful and versatile operating system.

## Linux Distributions
A Linux distribution (or distro) is a version of the Linux operating system that includes the Linux kernel and a collection of software applications and tools. Some popular distributions include:

- **Ubuntu**: Known for its user-friendliness and large community support.
- **Fedora**: Sponsored by Red Hat, known for its cutting-edge features.
- **Debian**: Known for its stability and vast repository of software packages.
- **CentOS**: A free version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), popular in server environments.

## Task: Install a Linux Distribution

### Option 1: Install on Your Computer
1. Choose a distribution (e.g., Ubuntu).
2. Download the ISO file from the official website.
3. Create a bootable USB drive using tools like Rufus (Windows) or Etcher (Mac/Linux).
4. Boot from the USB drive and follow the installation instructions.

### Option 2: Set Up a Virtual Machine
1. Install virtualization software like VirtualBox or VMware Workstation.
2. Download the ISO file of your chosen distribution.
3. Create a new virtual machine in your virtualization software.
4. Follow the setup wizard to install Linux on the virtual machine.
