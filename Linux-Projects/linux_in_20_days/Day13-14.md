# Day 13-14: Advanced Shell Scripting and System Monitoring

## Objectives
- Enhance your shell scripting skills with advanced techniques.
- Learn how to monitor system performance and resources.

## Advanced Shell Scripting

Building on the basics, advanced shell scripting techniques allow you to create more robust and efficient scripts. These include using functions, complex loops, and implementing error handling.

### Functions in Shell Scripts

Functions help organize your script into reusable blocks of code, making it easier to manage and understand.

- **Defining a Function**: Use the following syntax to define a function:
  ```
  my_function() {
  echo "This is a function"
  }
  ```

- **Calling a Function**: Simply use the function name to call it:
  ```
  my_function
  ```

### Advanced Loops

Advanced loops allow for more complex iteration patterns.

- **C-style For Loop**: Similar to C programming language syntax:
  ```
  for ((i=0; i<5; i++)); do
  echo "Iteration $i"
  done
  ```

- **While Loop**: Continues until a condition is false:
  ```
  count=0
  while [ $count -lt 5 ]; do
  echo "Count is $count"
  ((count++))
  done
  ```

### Error Handling

Implementing error handling ensures your script can manage unexpected situations gracefully.

- **Using Exit Status**: Check the exit status of commands to determine if they succeeded.
  ```
  mkdir /some/directory
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Directory created successfully"
  else
  echo "Failed to create directory"
  fi
  ```

- **Trap Command**: Capture signals and execute cleanup tasks.
  ```
  trap 'echo "Interrupt signal received"; exit' INT
  ```

## System Monitoring

Monitoring system performance is crucial for maintaining the health and efficiency of your Linux environment. Here are some essential tools:

### vmstat

The vmstat command reports virtual memory statistics.

- **Basic Usage**:
  ```
  vmstat
  ```
  Displays a summary of memory, processes, and CPU activity.

### iostat

The iostat command reports CPU and input/output statistics for devices and partitions.

- **Basic Usage**:
  ```
  iostat
  ```
  Provides an overview of CPU utilization and device I/O statistics.

### sar

The sar command collects, reports, or saves system activity information.

- **Basic Usage**:
  ```
  sar -u 1 3
  ```
  Reports CPU utilization every second for three seconds.

### htop

The htop command is an interactive process viewer for Unix systems.

- **Basic Usage**:
  ```
  htop
  ```
  Provides an interactive interface to view running processes and system resource usage. Use arrow keys to navigate and `q` to quit.

## Task

1. Create a shell script named `monitor_script.sh` that:
    - Uses functions to modularize tasks.
    - Implements error handling for commands.
    - Includes loops to perform repeated monitoring tasks.
2. Use system monitoring tools (vmstat, iostat, sar, htop) to analyze system performance.
3. Document any challenges you encounter and how you overcame them.
